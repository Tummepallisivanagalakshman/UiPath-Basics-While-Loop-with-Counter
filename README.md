# UiPath Basics – While Loop with Counter

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the **While** loop in UiPath to execute a set of activities repeatedly based on a condition.  
It is designed as a beginner practice task to understand condition-based looping and counter control.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Learn how the **While** loop works in UiPath  
- Understand condition-based iteration  
- Control loop execution using a counter variable  

---

## 🧩 Workflow Description
1. An integer variable named `counter` is initialized with the value `1`.
2. A **While** activity checks the condition `counter <= 5`.
3. Inside the loop:
   - A message box displays the current value of the counter.
   - The counter value is incremented by 1.
4. The loop stops automatically when the condition becomes false.
